## Introduction to Application Insights

Microsoft Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service that helps you monitor your live applications. It automatically detects performance anomalies and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and understand what users actually do with your app.

Integrating Application Insights with Power Platform solutions allows you to:

- Track custom events and metrics
- Monitor application performance
- Capture and analyze telemetry data
- Set up alerts for specific conditions
- Create custom dashboards for visualization

Follow the guides in this repository to learn how to implement these capabilities in your Power Platform solutions.
